Install the Latest Version of Python from python.org:

    Visit the Python Official Website:
        Open your web browser and go to python.org.

    Download Python:
        On the Python home page, click on the "Downloads" tab.
        Click on the "Python 3.x.x" download button (where "x.x.x" is the latest version).

    Run the Installer:
        Once the installer is downloaded, run the executable file.
        Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
        Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

    Verify Installation:
        Open a command prompt or terminal.
        Type python --version or python -V and press Enter to verify that Python is installed correctly.

Install Pip:

Pip is typically installed automatically with Python. However, if it's not installed, you can follow these steps:

    Open a Command Prompt or Terminal:
        Ensure that you are in the command-line interface.

    Install Pip:
        Run the following command:

        arduino

        python -m ensurepip --default-pip

    Verify Pip Installation:
        Type pip --version and press Enter to verify that Pip is installed correctly.

Install Required Libraries from Requirements:

Assuming you have a requirements.txt file listing the required libraries:

    Navigate to Your Project Directory:
        Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing your project files.

    Install Dependencies:
        Run the following command:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    This will install all the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run Python Script:

    Navigate to Your Project Directory:
        Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Python script (tec.py).

    Run the Script:
        Enter the following command:

        python tec.py

Provide the Year for Report Generation:

    Script Prompt:
        The script will prompt you to provide the year for report generation.
        Enter the desired year when prompted and press Enter.

    Wait for Completion:
        Allow the script to run, and it will generate the report for the specified year.
